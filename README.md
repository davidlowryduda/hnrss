=========

This is an RSS 2.0 generator for HackerNews, which remarkably does not have an RSS feed. In addition to correcting this very basic deficiency, this includes the top five comments in the data for the RSS feed for easier detection of interesting content from afar.

This relies on [feedmaker](https://github.com/davidlowryduda/feedmaker) for the generation of the feed itself.

There is currently no additional documentation for this package.
